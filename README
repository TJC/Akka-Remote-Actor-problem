Attempt at using Remote Actors with Akka.

Problem: It doesn't work!
Whenever I run it, the slave process reports a problem instantiating a class
from the Master thread when it comes to reply to it..
But I don't think it should even be creating that; it should just send the
message back to the other process, shouldn't it?


Instructions to recreate:
1) run 'sbt', 'update', 'compile'
2) In one window, run ./slave.sh
3) In another window, run ./master.sh


Alternative branch:
The 'master' branch is my first attempt, which has separate classes containing
the master and worker actors.
The 'common_actors' branch has been modified so that the actors are in a common
package, in case that helped with scoping. (It didn't work either.)
