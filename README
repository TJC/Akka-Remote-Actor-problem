Attempt at using Remote Actors with Akka.

Problem: It doesn't work (easily)!
Whenever I run it, the slave process reports a problem instantiating a class
from the Master thread when it comes to reply to it..
But I don't think it should even be creating that; it should just send the
message back to the other process, shouldn't it?


Instructions to recreate:
1) run 'sbt', 'update', 'compile'
2) In one window, run ./slave.sh
3) In another window, run ./master.sh


Alternative branches and solutions:
The 'master' branch is my first attempt, which has separate classes containing
the master and worker actors. It doesn't work.

The 'common_actors' branch has been modified so that the actors are in a common
package, in case that helped with scoping. (It didn't work either.)

The 'explicit_recipient' branch works! In this one, the master sets itself up
as a remote slave as well (on another port). In the slave, instead of using
self.reply(..), I fetch the remote actor for Master and pass it the message.
Although this works, it feels a bit messy; I thought Akka claimed to
automatically return messages to the sender? (ie. self.reply() should work)

The 'master_is_remote' branch works too!
In this one, the master is setup as a remote service, like in
'explicit_recipient'. However the slave doesn't explicitly send to that - it
just uses the self.reply() method, as in the first two branches. Yay!
This is an acceptable solution, to me - although I am curious to know why the
simple "hello world" example for Akka works without needing this stuff.
